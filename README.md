Elevator Pitch

Hi, my name is Taft Lakey and today I'm going to introduce you to my start up, FishPics. This is a new state of the art website where you and your friends can upload the fish you catch as well as find new fishing holes with tips to catch fish there from other fishers! This will be a website for fishers maintained by other fishers who just happen to love web development. You won't have to worry about an outdated web app because this is our passion project!

Key Features

- Upload your fishing photos
- Geo tracking which will update information about waters
- Option to show your gear used, which can inform other fishers about what you used
- Social media aspect which will involve sharing your fish with friends

Technology

HTML - Provide the basic structure for the web pages. Multiple HTML pages, one for each feature.

CSS - Designing the aesthetic of the web page. Making sure that it works for varying devices. Matching the color scheme to the varying styles of photos.

JavaScript - Allows for interaction in the website. Logging in

React - React will be used to develop an interactive user interface for the website. This will help create a dynamic and responsive experience.

Web service - This will provide the functions required to handle our fetch functions and provide endpoints. It can be used on the social side of our website to help users communicate. This will also be crucial for updating our map for fishing

Authentication: The authentication will be used to store information for our website's users. This will be neccesary to log into the website and communicate with other users. We will use an authentication service.

Database data: This will store our users data. This can be anything from the post they have made, liked and who their friends are. People can only post on the website if they have account information saved in our database

WebSocket data: This will be neccesary for a chat between users and updating users on new fish being caught in an area.
